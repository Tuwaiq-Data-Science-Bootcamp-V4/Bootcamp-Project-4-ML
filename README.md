# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction ✈️

# 📚 Introduction
Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years.

## 🎯 Objectives
The objective of the study is to analyze the flight booking dataset obtained from the "Ease My Trip" website and to conduct various statistical hypothesis tests in order to get meaningful information from it. The statistical algorithm would be used to train the dataset and predict the ticket prices of flights.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
Easemytrip is an internet platform for booking flight tickets, and hence a platform that potential passengers use to buy tickets. The dataset contains information about flight booking options from the website Easemytrip for flight travel between India's top 6 metro cities. There are 300,261 datapoints and 14 features.
